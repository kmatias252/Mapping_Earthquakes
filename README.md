# Mapping_Earthquakes

## Overview of Mapping Earthquakes Challenge:

The purpose of this project was to create an earthquake map with two different maps and the earthquake overlay. The objective is to see the earthquake data in relation to the tectonic plates' location on the earth, see all the earthquakes with a magnitude greater than 4.5 on the map and have visibility to a third "dark mode" map. 

## Results: 
* Deliverable 1: Add Tectonic Plate Data 
* Deliverable 2: Add Major Earthquake Data 
* Deliverable 3: Add an Additional Map "Dark mode"
